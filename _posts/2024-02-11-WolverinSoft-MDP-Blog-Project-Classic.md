# Hello There.

# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 18 hours
Welcome to my first blog post for this semester! Throughout the rest of these post in the upcoming days will be bi-weekly updates to showcase what I have accomplished and been up to within WolverinSoft Studio, as well as giving specific time details about my work and accomplishments. 

This is my second semester as a producer for the WolverinSoft Studio, and this semester we are working on Project Classic. It is a run-and-gun infinite runner rogue-lite based off of Gunstar Heroes.

# Weekly Meetings: 8 hours
Each week we meet from around 11am-2pm. These meetings include general admin updates (like studio wide announcments, project updates, etc.). Then we do squad meetings, which this year, design starts with a presentation and production (me) creates tasks based on what we need to get done. Then after that, we split into department meetings where the department directors assign their department members tasks to do for the sprint. I also talked with the Studio Director regarding possible process improvement protocols and mechanisms that could be implemented in future cycles in order to avoid some pitfalls that we have experienced in past dev-cycles.
# Production and Leads Meetings: 3 hours
Every week we also meet from 5:30-7:00pm online as a weekly leads meeting. This is to ensure all leads are up-to-date regarding what is going on between squads. This week was to ensure that Narrative and Art direction were solidified before the general meeting. Also some Design and Programming things needed to get done.
# Narrative Meeting: 3 hours

We also had a narrative meeting this week. Something I realise now, is the importance of a Creative Director in these kinds of things. When filling out the narrative document I realized how little we had solidified yet even though we were basically 1-2 sprints into the development cycle. But thats the thing, I feel that more time needs to be geared towarsd pre-production instead of rushing into production and having so much time wasted in producing things that could've been fixed, has we spent mroe time planning. And of course, there is only so much you can plan before its just too much. I read an article: [Are you solving the right problem](https://hbr.org/2012/09/are-you-solving-the-right-problem) which essentially outlines how important planning is... or more specifically how important it is to define the problem we are solving first. Currently as it is, there is no process in place to definitively define a direction in the studio. There is no one to nail in where we should be going due to the decentralized nature that is the structure of the Studio. This is not for no reason, as it allows for anyone to step up to leadership positions as well as ensuring that if someone is absent, others will be able to fill in. I feel that maybe the implementation of a Creative Director, just someone who has a vision of what the project should look like (maybe the pitch winner at the end of the semester?) would help to further solidify the direction of the game we are building and furhter increase the speed at which we can finish pre-production. Currently, it is sort-of the Art-Director, and sort-of the Design Director, and now sort-of the Narrative Department. But everyone has a different idea of what the game should be in their mind.
# Prototype Playtesting and Case Study Playtesting: 2 hours
I spent around 2 hours playtesting our prototype as it went through early iterations as well as playing the case study. The case study itself is pretty rough, in that it doesn't properly teach you how the game works (typical of the era... especially sega). However, I found great fun to be had in combining the different guns (my favorite being the line and homing weapon). Since theory-crafting strategies is one of my hobbies in video games I found this to be the most entertaining part of the game. It's not that run-and-gun 2D side-scrollers are not fun, but its more that the formula has been iterated on so much that there is only so much you can do to differentiate yourself from the rest. And I feel this addition of a combination of weapons makes for a refreshing experience I haven't had a in a while.
# Jira Tasks and other Admin Stuff: 2 hour
Production is also in charge of inputting Jira Tasks, Spreadsheets, Art Asset Sheets, etc. These take a while and are a lot of busy work to do but are incredibly important to keeping track of what is and isn't getting done throughout the Project.

# Conclusion
All in all, I am incredibly excited to see where this project goes, especially since it is a much more scaled-back project than the incredibly amitious Tails of War was.
