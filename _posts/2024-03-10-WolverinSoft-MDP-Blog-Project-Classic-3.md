# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 9 hours
Welcome to my third blog post for this semester! Throughout the rest of these post in the upcoming days will be bi-weekly updates to showcase what I have accomplished and been up to within WolverinSoft Studio, as well as giving specific time details about my work and accomplishments. 

This is my second semester as a producer for the WolverinSoft Studio, and this semester we are working on Project Classic. It is a run-and-gun infinite runner rogue-lite based off of Gunstar Heroes.

# Weekly Meetings: 4 hours
Each week we meet from around 11am-2pm. These meetings include general admin updates (like studio wide announcments, project updates, etc.). Then we do squad meetings, which this year, design starts with a presentation and production (me) creates tasks based on what we need to get done. Then after that, we split into department meetings where the department directors assign their department members tasks to do for the sprint. This weeks focus was around getting Art Assets finalized and figuring out Audio Department Logistics.
# Production and Leads Meetings: 3 hours
Every week we also meet from 5:30-7:00pm online as a weekly leads meeting. This is to ensure all leads are up-to-date regarding what is going on between squads. This week was to ensure that Narrative and Art direction were solidified before the general meeting. Also some Design and Programming things needed to get done. This sprints meetings contained just quick checkins as a lot of these things were planned beforehand.
# Production Process Improvement: 3 hours
As we continue further into development, the more I am realizing how important it is that we have a concrete plan before we start production. I have discussed with the Studio Director regarding many different potential process changes. I will go over a few outlined underneath.
## - Setting Art Style and Theme beforehand.
One of the big issues I am seeing in production is that Art is incredibly lagging behind. This is due to a multitude of things which is a combination of: People not communicating well, people not doing their work on time, people not understanding what they are supposed to be doing. And a bunch of other things. As such, I thought I'd look at how Studio used to do things. In the beginning days, it looked like we generally had a narrative outline, art style guide, etc. Before the game was in the production phase. These would help artists coming in immediately start concept art (That is another thing, our Art Pipeline isn't exactly clear? There are so many things that are not clear that need to be soldified). But now we onboard artists, then choose an artsyle. Which this cycle has taken almost an ENTIRE SPRINT to complete. So in the games industry, we wouldn't started production but still be in the pre-production side for Art. Isn't that completely bonkers and weird?!?!?!
The counter argument to this change was that you don't know who you're going to get in terms of talent. But UMICH Stamps is primarily 2D artists? So sticking with that alone should be good enough. Even then, artists were not exactly happy with being onboarded to the project and not having a style guide to follow. Its 2 conflicting views between leads and regular members
## - Hiring Proccesses
Another pain point... or not exactly... more of something to improve, is the Hiring Process. Right now the way out sheets are set up isn't exactly ideal for hiring new members. As the amount of people we get per year is a lot. Potential solutions include: buying software for this stuff, learning and using Excel to set up google sheets properly, or scripting things to make sure these all work. Currently the Studio Director has 2-3 people working on scripting. I'm not entirely sure how to address this pain point, because I personally haven't started to deal with it yet. 
## - Jira Workflow Improvement
The more we use Jira and the more I do production research, the more I am seeing that we are not using Jira to its fullest potential. Tell me. What is the point of using an incredibly complex and feature-rich ticketing system, and only using the Kanban board to fill a backlog???????????????????? It isn't set-up properly so that I can link issues, we aren't using the roadmap function, our sprint planning isn't exactly the way it should be (not by milestones or features, but sprint by sprint). It also doesn't help that we are using an incredibly outdated version of Jira. I wishing that there was someone who I could have constant access to, to consult directly about Jira, Scrum planning, and video production in general.


# Prototype Playtesting and Case Study Playtesting: 2 hours
I spent around 2 hours playtesting our prototype, as well as playing the case study.
# Jira Tasks and other Admin Stuff: 2 hour
Production is also in charge of inputting Jira Tasks, Spreadsheets, Art Asset Sheets, etc. These take a while and are a lot of busy work to do but are incredibly important to keeping track of what is and isn't getting done throughout the Project.

# Conclusion
This week coming back has been a little hectic. We only have one more sprint to get things in, then its up to polishing during the QA week, then launch. Art hasn't exactly been on top of things which worries me about getting assets in. Otherwise, everything else seems to be on task! The game (mechnics wise) seems to be turning out to be super fun! Super looking forward to seeing this game finished!
