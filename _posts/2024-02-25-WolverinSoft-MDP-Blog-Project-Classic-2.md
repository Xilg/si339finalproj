# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 18 hours
Welcome to my second blog post for this semester! Throughout the rest of these post in the upcoming days will be bi-weekly updates to showcase what I have accomplished and been up to within WolverinSoft Studio, as well as giving specific time details about my work and accomplishments. 

This is my second semester as a producer for the WolverinSoft Studio, and this semester we are working on Project Classic. It is a run-and-gun infinite runner rogue-lite based off of Gunstar Heroes.

# Weekly Meetings: 8 hours
Each week we meet from around 11am-2pm. These meetings include general admin updates (like studio wide announcments, project updates, etc.). Then we do squad meetings, which this year, design starts with a presentation and production (me) creates tasks based on what we need to get done. Then after that, we split into department meetings where the department directors assign their department members tasks to do for the sprint. This weeks focus was around getting Art Assets finalized and figuring out Audio Department Logistics.
# Production and Leads Meetings: 3 hours
Every week we also meet from 5:30-7:00pm online as a weekly leads meeting. This is to ensure all leads are up-to-date regarding what is going on between squads. This week was to ensure that Narrative and Art direction were solidified before the general meeting. Also some Design and Programming things needed to get done. This sprints meetings contained just quick checkins as a lot of these things were planned beforehand.
# Narrative Meeting: 3 hours
This weeks Narrative Meeting was focused on the dialogues and the shopkeeper in the game. A lot of focus in the beginning was on what the shopkeeper stuff might look like. But in the end we had one of our designers come in and thankfully save us a lot of headache.
# Prototype Playtesting and Case Study Playtesting: 2 hours
I spent around 2 hours playtesting our prototype, as well as playing the case study.
# Jira Tasks and other Admin Stuff: 2 hour
Production is also in charge of inputting Jira Tasks, Spreadsheets, Art Asset Sheets, etc. These take a while and are a lot of busy work to do but are incredibly important to keeping track of what is and isn't getting done throughout the Project.

# Conclusion
All in all, this sprint was a lot like the last sprint, but because of Spring Break and Mid-terms people largely dialed back on the work they were contributing to the project. I think that in the future we should definitely plan for this. In our current timeline there is no mention of Spring Break and it assumes people do their work. But in reality, during this time most people are preparing for exams or getting ready for Spring Break. Otherwise, I also think that we need more planning and structure. I saw that a lot of people didn't know what was going on, and this being due to not having a proper sprint goal planned out. I think setting milestones in our project planning and following basic project management roadmaps would be incredibly benficial to WolverineSoft Studio.
