# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 9 hours
Welcome to my Fourth blog post for this semester! Throughout the rest of these post in the upcoming days will be bi-weekly updates to showcase what I have accomplished and been up to within WolverinSoft Studio, as well as giving specific time details about my work and accomplishments. 

This is my second semester as a producer for the WolverinSoft Studio, and this semester we are working on Project Classic. It is a run-and-gun infinite runner rogue-lite based off of Gunstar Heroes.

# Weekly Meetings: 4 hours
Each week we meet from around 11am-2pm. These meetings include general admin updates (like studio wide announcments, project updates, etc.). Then we do squad meetings, which this year, design starts with a presentation and production (me) creates tasks based on what we need to get done. Then after that, we split into department meetings where the department directors assign their department members tasks to do for the sprint. This weeks focus was around getting Art Assets finalized and figuring out Audio Department Logistics.
# Production and Leads Meetings: 3 hours
Every week we also meet from 5:30-7:00pm online as a weekly leads meeting. This is to ensure all leads are up-to-date regarding what is going on between squads. This week was to ensure that Narrative and Art direction were solidified before the general meeting. Also some Design and Programming things needed to get done. This sprints meetings contained just quick checkins as a lot of these things were planned beforehand.
# Production Process Improvement: 3 hours+ (Honestly I'm not sure how much time I've put into it at this point)
I'm learning more and more that producers in WolverinsoftStudio are nothing more than glorified supervisors. The implementation of which has been shoddy at best. In industry, the producer's job is the make sure that the team they are supervising is on track to hit the release date that they have set. However, because we (for some reason??) don't have a proper roadmap that we are sticking to, we run sprint-by-sprint. And because of that, when you ask around the studio about the status of the game, often-times what you get is "its all good", or "I'm not sure". In the below, I will outline possible solutions that may be enacted upon in the future
## EECS 494 2.0
EECS 494 currently offers the unique opportunity for CS Students to work not only with CS students but also PAT305 students to develop a game. For the past... years many, if not a majority of EECS494 games have consistently been of higher quality (Less buggy, more solidified direction, more fun...) than any of the WolverinSoft Studio games that have been produced. You'd think that with more time and man-power we would have a somewhat polished game by the end of the cycle. It anything the opposite has happened, where the most impressive game that studio has produced - in my opinion - was probably its DreamWillow and Bloom. Somewhere down the line someone thought that Bigger = Better and allowed Studio to grow to the slow, lumbering, giant that it currently is. Hence my current proposal: A summer EECS 494 2.0. A proper hiring process, then put them into groups of around 10-ish then have them go through the formal game design ideation process and create "polished" prototypes. Then at the end of the cycle have them pitch them, and have the WolverineSoft Studio put those prototypes into production. So here would be the basic idea:
### Weeks 1-2
Teams are formed and are tasked with creating, and submitting a formal design documentation. They will also submit a roadmap (Pre-alpha, Alpha (feature complete), Beta (content complete), Gold) for their development plan as well as market research.
### Weeks up until July 29th
- Biweekly or Weekly (not entirely sure yet) playtests between all groups
- During weeks we will offer spaces for groups to work on their games for
### July 29th - Pitch Day & Showcase
- Teams will Pitch their games to the other teams as well as a panel of judges (tbd who those will be)
- Showcase ensues after that
- Then voting for crowd favorite and judges choice
Top 2 winners will get their projects put into production during the year!

# The value proposition of Studio
Now the main draw of Studio currently is that it offers the chance for students to work collaboratively in a bigger-ish studio environment. However, the Studio doesn't have processes in place to act like a Studio properly nor the proper expertise to properly delegate roles. For example: in a larger company you have Modellers, Texture Artists, Riggers, etc. Specialized roles that people have honed their skills for years in. But in Studio there hasn't been enough time for people to specialize. We have Artists complaining about improper implementation of Art Assets while Programmers complain about Artists complaining. Where I think the real problem is that there isn't a proper design documentation on how these things should be implemented, just that they should...

https://studio.eecs.umich.edu/confluence/display/CLAS/Player 

Take classics current design documentation, most of it is relegated to the implementation by the programming part. NONE of which specifies how it should be implemented in the art end. Shouldn't designers consider how it should be implemented animation wise? Because Video Games are an incredibly Visual Art Form? But because we have relgated the entirety of our design team to programmers we see that kind of documentation: Made by Programmers, For Programmers. And we see the consequences of that in mediocre movement animations and rigging done by programmers. But the issue is much more complex. Like we could have Artists properly trained in Unity to be rigging experts, we could have programmers properly communicate with Artists how they would like things to be implemented, maybe a more diverse design team or specialized design roles: Animation design, mechanical design, level design, etc. 

Then there is a whole communication aspect that needs to be solved: Our team doesn't talk to each other. The most we get is during the Sunday meetings during squad level meetings. One way to solve this would be to have dedicated social events, which a lot of people have been wanting, but for some unknown reason has never been put forth. I think one reason is that we would need to pay for it somehow. But because the budget of Studio comes from the Club it is incredibly difficult to pay for the things needed (mainly food) for social gatherings. Which leads me to question: Why is Studio apart of the Club? Is it due to the restrictions that come with being a club, so that we don't need officers, treasurers, etc. ? Otherwise I'm not entirely sure... was it just because that is how it started? Honestly I'm not sure. But as it stands right now: Studio culture is one that facilitates a lack of communication between departments, non-commitment (people have to pick up the slack for others), and a culture where the Programmers are put first and foremost and other opinions secondary. And for some reason our marketing department doesn't meet with Studio? So their knowledge of what is going on during Studio is zero to none. Why this is? I have no idea. All I know is that a drafted outline for a trailer was sent, and it was incredibly off of what the game we are building is... Again: facilitates a lack of communication between departments and non-commitement.


# Prototype Playtesting and Case Study Playtesting: 2 hours
I spent around 2 hours playtesting our prototype, as well as playing the case study.
# Jira Tasks and other Admin Stuff: 2 hour
Production is also in charge of inputting Jira Tasks, Spreadsheets, Art Asset Sheets, etc. These take a while and are a lot of busy work to do but are incredibly important to keeping track of what is and isn't getting done throughout the Project.

# Conclusion
The more I dig into why Studio does things the more I realize no one knows why. The common answer I get is "It is industry standard" or "It's because this is the way things have always been". I know WWISE is incredibly common in the industry, but more common than not it has been a point of contention among our audio team due to its complexity... and we don't even use the complex features that WWISE offers. Most of the time we are just fighting it, when we could've just used the built in Unity Audio System to implement em. Same with Jira and Confluence. I've had Artists and Designers admit to straight up never looking at the confluence because of how cumbersome they are. Jira tickets are often left unassigned, not updated, or straight-up ignored. I could go on honestly, why do we do Steam releases? Why do we have a marketing team? Why do we have a QA team thats basically just the programming team? Why do we not have playtests between our 2 projects? Why do we use Jira and Confluence? Why don't we have a training program for people that want to join Studio? Why is our hiring process just one google form and nothing more? To end, I will pose this question: Why is it that our (arguebly) most polished game (DreamWillow) was produced entirely with Google Docs and Sheets (...ok bloom was pretty cool too and THAT used Jira and Confluence).
